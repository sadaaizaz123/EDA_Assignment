🎯 Objectives
The main goals of this project are to:
Clean and preprocess the Zomato dataset
Merge and map country information
Analyze restaurant ratings, cuisines, and price ranges
Identify patterns across countries and cities
Visualize insights using data visualization libraries

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
Python 3.x
Pandas – data manipulation and cleaning
NumPy – numerical computations
Matplotlib – basic plotting
Seaborn – advanced and aesthetic visualizations
Jupyter Notebook – analysis and documentation environment

📊 Key Insights
Some highlights from the analysis include:
The countries with the most Zomato-listed restaurants
Popular cuisines and their average ratings
Relationship between cost and rating
Distribution of restaurant ratings across cities
Visual breakdown of online delivery and booking options
(Detailed insights and graphs are available in the notebook.)

🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
Removed unnecessary columns
Handled missing values
Merged Country-Code.xlsx to map country names
Removed duplicate entries
Converted categorical data into meaningful labels

📈 Visualizations
The analysis includes multiple visualizations such as:
Top 10 countries with most restaurants
Most popular cuisines
Rating distributions
Average cost comparison by country
Heatmaps for correlation between numerical columns

🧠 Future Work
Build interactive dashboards using Plotly or Power BI
Predict restaurant ratings using Machine Learning
Automate data updates from APIs
